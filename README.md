# She-Connect

# Inspiration
We were inspired to create this project because of our own personal experiences witnessing violence against women and because of the events we have witnessed in our university campus environment. We know that safety is one of the biggest issues women are facing right now. Whether is be in the workplace, at home or anywhere else. We realised that many women feel fearful and lonely in situation where they are experiencing violence so we wanted to create an online community for them to interact with professionals and other women who have been in similar situations. They can seek advice and even take action by submitting a report to the police through our solution.

# What it does
She Connect is an interactive website aimed at initiating discussions about problems related to womenâ€™s safety. Our goal is to raise awareness about violence against women. Our website includes a community discussions forum, a report incidents page and a contact&help page. In the discussions forum, the users are able to make posts about any situations involving violence they have been a part of and get legal, as well as, general advice on what they should do in the situation. Whether legal action can be taken or just seeking the comfort of others who can related to what they have gone through.

# How we built it
For She Connect, we focused heavily on building a clean, responsive, and intuitive front-end to ensure that users feel comfortable navigating the site. We used HTML and CSS for structuring and styling, paying special attention to accessibility and visual appeal. JavaScript was essential in creating dynamic elements, like the discussion forum and report forms, providing users with an interactive experience.

# Challenges we ran into
Building advanced frontend features like forums and comment sections required intricate design and development work. Ensuring that these components interacted seamlessly with each other and the rest of the platform was a significant challenge.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully launched the forum and comment sections, providing users with a platform to connect and share experiences. Taking on a new challenge and coming up with a presentable final product.

#What we learned
The value of agile development became clear as we continuously refined features based on user feedback and testing.

#What's next for She-Connect
We plan to introduce additional features based on user feedback, such as tagging in comments and more personalized user profiles.
